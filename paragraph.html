This code is a basic prototype of an online shopping web application. It demonstrates how e-commerce websites work at a simple level. The page displays a list of products (like a shirt, shoes, and watch) with their prices. When the user clicks ‚ÄúAdd to Cart‚Äù, the product is added to a shopping cart. The cart section shows the items the user selected, their quantities, and the running total price.

The main purpose of this code is to simulate the core functionality of an online store: browsing products, selecting them, and keeping track of the purchase total. Although it doesn‚Äôt include advanced features like user accounts, payments, or a backend database, it helps beginners understand how HTML (structure), CSS (styling), and JavaScript (logic) work together to build interactive shopping experiences on the web.

üëâ In short, this code is useful for learning and practicing e-commerce basics, and it can be expanded later into a full online shopping site with real products, checkout, and payment integration.
